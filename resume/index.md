## Programs
​
### Innsbrook Chamber Music Institute — MO, Summer 2018
Placed in a chamber group based on my audition recordings, I participated in intensive daily coaching and rehearsal sessions with faculty that included internationally recognized artists-teachers and Saint Louis Symphony musicians with extensive coaching and mentoring backgrounds. Honored with a performance slot in both a chamber music master class and the final concert, I was not just appreciative of the incredible level of performance but also worked closely with top echelon musicians who dedicate their life to music making.

### Young Women’s Political Leadership Program — Summer 2018
Held in Washington, DC annually since 2007, this nonpartisan, flagship program introduces a highly selective group of 50 high school girls from across the nation to the power of political leadership. While staying in the Georgetown dorms, I participated in workshops led by experts in public speaking, networking, fundraising, on-camera media training, and advocacy. It was fascinating to meet girls from a wide variety of backgrounds.  Excelling in the mock fund raising exercise, I discovered skills I didn’t know I had.

​
